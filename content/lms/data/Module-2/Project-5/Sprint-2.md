This week you'll work on the e-commerce EDA using Python. **You will use a Python SQL connector to perform queries on your newly created database.**

This is your third EDA, so we are confident you can do this easily. This time, you will create a report at the end of the project that will be presented to the management team of 'VS Group.' They would like to see how much you have understood the E-Commerce business and your data analysis keeping in mind all the KPIs.

## Epic 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

There are plenty of insights you can deduce from this dataset. Try to look for some these insights yourself. As a starting point, here are some ideas which you could present to the team:

- What customer purchasing patterns can you discover? Such as activity during the days of the week, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.

- Are there specific days/months/quarters when the sales have been unusually high/low, and what could be the possible reasons? How about the profit and loss margin?

- Which States and which customers made the highest number of orders? Are they the same as the highest spending States and customers?

- Can you make a map showing the 5 States generating the most and least sales revenue?

- Can we see any patterns in the quarterly revenue behavior?

- Can you create a plot showing the growth rate of new customers over the months?

- What do you think about the customers? Are they individuals or wholesalers? Why would you say so?

- Are there any issues with the dataset?

**You don't have to create all these plots. Choose the most relevant ones for your analysis.**

**Optional: make a small selection of the plots and try to present them as Plotly-Express animations. Please remember that the most important thing is to make a good analysis, independent of which library you use to create your graphs.**

## Epic 2: Suggest meaningful KPIs for VS Group's business

As previously stated in the spike about KPIs, a KPI, or key performance indicator, is a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective. They are commonly written using the SMART technique:

- Specific: What exactly does the company want to achieve?

- Measurable: How will the management identify that the goal has been achieved?

- Achievable: Is the goal attainable?

- Relevant: How does it help the overall business objectives?

- Time-bound: When will the goal be delivered, and what are the key milestones along the way?

**Considering all this information, present 2-4 KPIs that you think would add value to VS Group in their business.**
