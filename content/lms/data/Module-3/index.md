### üë©‚Äçüíª The module

In this module, you will get introduced to more advanced technologies and concepts and you will have to work on your final project.

During the first two weeks, you will make a Data Pipeline project. Time permitting - if the buffer week has not been used up elsewhere - you will have the opportunity to work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced time series analysis, with the intent to integrate these into your data pipeline.

After this, you will have to choose the topic of your final project. You will have 3 more weeks to work on it, and you will have a presentation at the end.

The final project is the most important project of the course. Here is where you can apply all the knowledge you have gained in the past months. The topic is completely free and up to you, but before starting to work on it, you should discuss it with your mentor to define the scope and goals for the best chance at success.

We have broadly outlined 2 possible final projects, which reflect 2 different positions you could have on the job market.

##### Data / Business Analyst

Take a business / domain that interests you and analyse it.

Use all the tools / techologies that you want, and learn new ones if you want. Use some simple Machine Learning predictions to spice you analysis up.

##### Data Engineer Project

Build a data pipeline and show meaningful insights through the web (you can use Streamlit Cloud and/or Plotly Dash for showing plots in an interactive web-based app, for example).
