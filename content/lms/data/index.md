Welcome to the Data Science Program at Code Academy Berlin!

## Protocols

Before you start your journey, we would encourage you to go through the below protocols:

### Code Every Day

Consistency is essential when you are learning a new language. Therefore, we recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding every day will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting initially, consider starting small with 25 minutes daily and working your way up.

### Write It Out

As you progress as a new programmer, you may wonder if you should be taking notes. Yes, you should! In fact, research suggests that taking notes by hand is most beneficial for long-term retention. This will be especially beneficial for those working towards becoming full-time developers, as many interviews will involve writing code on a whiteboard.

Once you start working on small projects and programs, writing by hand can also help you plan your code before you move to the computer. You can save a lot of time if you write out which functions and classes you will need and how they will interact.

### Take Breaks

It is essential to step away and absorb the concepts when you are learning. The Pomodoro Technique is widely used and can help: you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when taking in a lot of new information.

Breaks are essential when you are debugging. Take a break if you hit a bug and can’t figure out what is going wrong. Step away from your computer and take a short walk or chat with a friend.

In programming, your code must follow the rules of the language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything.

Fresh eyes make a big difference.

### Surround Yourself With Others Who Are Learning

Though coding may seem like a solitary activity, it actually works best when you work together. Therefore, it is vital when you are learning to code that you surround yourself with other people who are also learning.

This will allow you to share the tips and tricks you learn.

### Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique that involves two developers working at one workstation to complete a task. The two developers switch between being the “driver” and the “navigator.” The “driver” writes the code, while the “navigator” helps guide the problem-solving and reviews the code as it is written. Switch frequently to get the benefit of both sides.

Pair programming has many benefits: it allows you to have someone review your code and see how someone else might be thinking about a problem. In addition, exposure to multiple ideas and ways of thinking will help you problem-solve when you get back to coding on your own.

### Ask “GOOD” Questions

People always say there is no such thing as a bad question, but when it comes to programming, it is possible to ask a question badly. When you are asking for help from someone who has little or no context on the problem you are trying to solve, its best to ask GOOD questions by following this acronym:

G: Give context on what you are trying to do, and learn how to describe the problem for your mentor.

O: Outline the things you have already tried to fix the issue.

O: Offer your analysis before asking your mentor. This helps the person helping you not only know what you are thinking but also know that you have done some thinking on your own.

D: Demonstrate what is happening. Include the code, a traceback error message, and an explanation of the steps you executed that resulted in the error.

This way, the person helping does not have to try to recreate the issue.
Good questions can save a lot of time. Skipping any of these steps can result in back-and-forth conversations that can cause conflict. As a beginner, you want to ask good questions to practice communicating your thought process so that people who help you will be happy to continue helping you.

Alright! Now is the time to start the projects.
